## Phase 5 - Polish & Testing

### 🔧 Task 16: Add Multi-Command Dev Server Launch Support
**Priority:** Medium | **Status:** TODO 📝

**Problem Statement:**
Currently Oddbox only supports single-line commands in the "Command" field. Many dev servers require multiple commands to be executed in sequence (e.g., setting Node version, then running the dev server). Users need the ability to specify multi-line command sequences that Oddbox will execute automatically.

**Scope:**
Replace the single "Command" field with a multi-line "Launch Commands" field that allows users to specify multiple commands that will be executed sequentially when starting the dev server.

**IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:**
- **This is NOT about setup instructions or documentation**
- **This IS about the actual commands Oddbox will execute to run the dev server**
- **Users should NEVER touch a terminal after initial configuration**
- **Oddbox executes ALL commands automatically when user clicks "Start"**

**Example Use Cases:**
```
Launch Commands for vets-website:
nvm use 14.15
yarn watch

Launch Commands for Python Django:
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver

Launch Commands for Rails with specific Ruby:
rbenv use 3.0.0
bundle exec rails server

Launch Commands for Next.js with environment:
export NODE_ENV=development
npm run dev
```

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Backend (Rust)**:
   - Replace `command: String` with `launchCommands: String` in AppConfig struct
   - Modify `start_app_process` to handle multi-line commands
   - Execute commands sequentially using shell script approach
   - Update JSON schema and ensure backwards compatibility
   - Convert single command configs to multi-line format automatically

2. **Frontend (TypeScript)**:
   - Replace command field with launchCommands in AppConfig interface
   - Replace single-line input with multi-line textarea in AppConfigModal
   - Update validation to ensure at least one non-empty command
   - Show command count and preview in app cards/headers

3. **Command Execution Logic**:
   - Create temporary shell script from multi-line commands
   - Execute shell script in working directory with proper environment
   - Stream all command output to terminal in real-time
   - Handle command failures gracefully (stop execution, show error)

4. **UI/UX**:
   - Large multi-line textarea labeled "Launch Commands"
   - Helpful placeholder: "Enter the commands to start your dev server (one per line)"
   - Show command preview/summary in main app header
   - Clear indication of multi-command vs single-command apps

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] AppConfigModal has multi-line textarea for launch commands instead of single command input
- [ ] Multiple commands execute sequentially when starting app
- [ ] Each command's output streams to terminal in real-time
- [ ] Command execution stops on first failure with clear error message
- [ ] Single-line commands still work (backwards compatibility)
- [ ] Existing app configurations migrate automatically
- [ ] Multi-line commands save/load correctly
- [ ] Terminal shows output from all executed commands

**Verification Steps:**
- [ ] Can enter multiple commands in app configuration
- [ ] Commands execute in correct sequence when starting app
- [ ] Each command's output appears in terminal
- [ ] Command failure stops execution and shows error
- [ ] Single command apps continue working normally
- [ ] Existing configs load without issues
- [ ] Commands work across platforms (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- [ ] Configuration import/export preserves multi-line commands

**Out of Scope:**
- Interactive command prompts or user input during execution
- Conditional command execution based on environment
- Command templates or wizards
- Parallel command execution
- Command timeout or cancellation (beyond normal process termination)

### ✅ Task 17: Fix App Configuration and Terminal Output Issues (COMPLETED - Commit: a47f9b3)
**Priority:** HIGH 🚨 | **Status:** Complete ✅ | **Committed:** a47f9b3 | **Pushed:** ✅ | **Issue:** #20 (Closed)

**Issue Description:**
Three critical user experience issues that were addressed:

1. **Sidebar Population Issue**: When adding a new app through the modal, the app information appears in the main header but does not populate in the sidebar list
2. **Terminal Live Feed Issue**: When clicking "Start" on an app, the terminal does not display real-time output from the running process
3. **Default Browser Opening Enhancement**: Add option to open URLs in the system's default browser instead of just auto-launch on app start

**What was accomplished:**
- ✅ **Fixed Terminal Live Output**: Terminal now displays real-time process output with proper stdout/stderr handling
- ✅ **Fixed Terminal Output Duplication**: Resolved double-line issue by properly converting process manager output
- ✅ **Added NVM Support**: Enhanced process execution to properly initialize Node Version Manager for Node.js projects
- ✅ **Improved Configuration State Management**: Fixed async handling in useConfigManager to ensure proper state synchronization
- ✅ **Enhanced Process Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging for better process monitoring and debugging
- ✅ **Browser Opening**: Confirmed existing browser opening functionality works correctly using useBrowser hook

**Root Cause Analysis & Solutions:**
- **Terminal Issue**: Process output events were properly emitted but duplication occurred due to double processing in Terminal component - fixed by consolidating output handling
- **NVM Issue**: Shell processes spawned without proper environment initialization - fixed by detecting and initializing NVM when needed
- **State Sync Issue**: saveConfig calls weren't awaited properly - fixed async handling in useConfigManager

**Verified Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Terminal displays live output from running processes in real-time
- ✅ No duplicate lines appear in terminal output
- ✅ Node.js projects with NVM commands execute successfully
- ✅ Process start/stop lifecycle works correctly with proper cleanup
- ✅ Browser auto-launch and manual "Open URL" functionality working
- ✅ Configuration state synchronizes properly between components
- ✅ All existing functionality continues to work (no regressions)

**Current State for Next Developer:**
- All three critical UX issues have been resolved
- Terminal output system is fully functional with real-time process streaming
- NVM/Node.js project support is working correctly
- Browser opening functionality confirmed working in both auto-launch and manual modes
- Configuration state management is robust and properly synchronized
- Ready for advanced features and additional polish tasks

**Issue Description:**
Three critical user experience issues need to be addressed:

1. **Sidebar Population Issue**: When adding a new app through the modal, the app information appears in the main header but does not populate in the sidebar list
2. **Terminal Live Feed Issue**: When clicking "Start" on an app, the terminal does not display real-time output from the running process
3. **Default Browser Opening Enhancement**: Add option to open URLs in the system's default browser instead of just auto-launch on app start

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Sidebar Issue**: Likely a state synchronization problem between the configuration manager and the LibrarySidebar component
- **Terminal Issue**: Process output events may not be properly connected to the terminal display or the event listeners are not working correctly
- **Browser Issue**: Current implementation focuses on auto-launch; need manual "Open in Browser" functionality using system default browser

**Implementation Plan:**

1. **Fix Sidebar Population**:
   - Debug the app addition flow in App.tsx → AppConfigModal → useConfigManager → LibrarySidebar
   - Ensure configuration changes trigger proper re-renders in LibrarySidebar
   - Verify selectedApp state updates correctly when new apps are added
   - Test the onAppSelect callback chain

2. **Fix Terminal Live Output**:
   - Verify process-output events are being emitted correctly from Rust backend
   - Debug the event listeners in useProcessManager hook
   - Ensure Terminal component receives and displays rawOutput from process manager
   - Test the process start → output capture → display pipeline

3. **Add Default Browser Functionality**:
   - Enhance MainAppHeader with manual "Open URL" button functionality
   - Improve useBrowser hook to handle various URL formats
   - Add user preference for default browser behavior
   - Test cross-platform browser opening (Windows/Linux/macOS)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Adding new app via modal immediately shows app in sidebar list
- [ ] Selected app state updates correctly when new apps are added
- [ ] Clicking "Start" on any app shows live terminal output in real-time
- [ ] Terminal displays both stdout and stderr from running processes
- [ ] Manual "Open URL" button in header opens URLs in default system browser
- [ ] Browser opening works across platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- [ ] All existing functionality continues to work (no regressions)

**Verification Steps:**
- [ ] Add new app through modal - verify it appears immediately in sidebar
- [ ] Select newly added app - verify it shows correctly in main header
- [ ] Start any app - verify terminal shows live output as process runs
- [ ] Test both successful and failing processes - verify appropriate output
- [ ] Click "Open URL" button - verify it opens in default browser
- [ ] Test on different platforms if possible
- [ ] Verify no existing features are broken

**Technical Tasks:**
- [ ] Debug LibrarySidebar state management and re-rendering
- [ ] Debug process output event flow from backend to frontend
- [ ] Debug Terminal component rawOutput processing
- [ ] Enhance browser opening functionality with manual controls
- [ ] Add proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Test all scenarios thoroughly

**Out of Scope:**
- Major architectural changes to event system
- Custom browser selection (use system default)
- Terminal output formatting improvements
- Performance optimizations

### ✅ Task 18: Fix UI/UX Issues and Improvements (COMPLETED - Commit: 0eda93b)
**Priority:** HIGH 🚨 | **Status:** Complete ✅ | **Committed:** 0eda93b | **Pushed:** ✅ | **Issue:** #21 (Closed)

**Issue Description:**
Multiple UI/UX issues that were addressed to improve user experience:

1. **Title Changes Not Reflected in Sidebar**: When editing and changing the app title, changes are reflected in the header, but not in the sidebar
2. **Header Command Display**: The header should put more emphasis on the Command as a large block, not just a short line, and the URL should not be truncated - it should be fully visible if possible
3. **Default Window Size**: The default launch should be a larger window footprint rather than its default small squareish launch
4. **Button Layout**: Prefer start button and icons onto a new row, so command/directory/URL can enjoy full width if necessary
5. **Responsive Header Icons**: When shrunk horizontally, the icons in the header sort of get in the way and it's not responsive
6. **Button Colors**: The start button is the wrong color, it should be blue like add app in the sidebar. There should be no green color anywhere, not on highlight. States are either blue or red. Icons do not need any fancy colors for highlighting or active, just something simple hover
7. **Modal Selection Issue**: If you are doing edits in the edit modal, you start selecting a field, drag, and your mouse lands outside of the modal, then you release your mouse, it closes the modal, which we don't want

**What was accomplished:**
- ✅ **Fixed Default Window Size**: Updated Tauri configuration from 800x600 to 1200x800 for better initial user experience
- ✅ **Updated Color Scheme**: Removed all green colors throughout the application, implemented consistent blue/red state system
- ✅ **Redesigned Header Layout**: 
  - Commands now display in larger, more prominent blocks with proper formatting
  - URLs and directories show in full without truncation using dedicated containers
  - Better visual hierarchy and information display
- ✅ **Improved Button Layout**: 
  - Moved start button and action icons to separate row for better responsive design
  - Full width utilization for command/directory/URL information
  - Better vertical layout organization
- ✅ **Enhanced Responsive Design**: 
  - Improved icon and button behavior on narrow screens
  - Better responsive breakpoints for mobile and tablet views
  - Cleaner layout adaptation across different screen sizes
- ✅ **Fixed Button Colors**: 
  - Start button now uses blue color matching design system
  - All action buttons follow blue (active) and red (error/delete) color scheme
  - Removed green highlight colors throughout application
  - Simplified hover states for better UX
- ✅ **Fixed Modal Text Selection**: 
  - Modal no longer closes when dragging text selection outside modal bounds
  - Improved text selection UX within form fields
- ✅ **Added Automatic Sidebar Updates**: 
  - Implemented useEffect to sync selectedApp when configuration changes
  - Sidebar now properly reflects title changes immediately after editing
  - Fixed state synchronization between header and sidebar components

**Verified Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Title changes in edit modal immediately update sidebar display
- ✅ Header shows commands as larger, more prominent blocks
- ✅ URLs display fully without truncation when possible
- ✅ App launches with larger default window size (1200x800)
- ✅ Start button and icons moved to new row for better layout
- ✅ Header icons behave responsively on narrow screens
- ✅ Start button is blue color, no green colors anywhere in UI
- ✅ Modal doesn't close when dragging text selection outside modal bounds
- ✅ All color states follow blue (active/running) and red (stopped/error) scheme
- ✅ Icons have simple hover states without fancy active colors

**Current State for Next Developer:**
- All UI/UX issues have been resolved and verified working
- Application now provides much better user experience with improved layout and responsive design
- Color scheme is consistent throughout the application using only blue/red states
- Modal text selection works properly without unexpected closures
- Sidebar automatically updates when app configurations change
- **Additional Refinements (Commit: 1250bdc):**
  - Header layout significantly refined with Steam-like start button styling
  - Action buttons reduced to essential Edit and Delete only
  - URL and directory made clickable to replace separate buttons
  - Controls consolidated into single row saving vertical space
  - Auto-scroll icon in terminal fixed (proper ArrowDown icon)
  - Responsive design updated for new compact layout
- Ready for additional polish tasks or advanced features
