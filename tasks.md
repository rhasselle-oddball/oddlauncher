**Priority:** HIGH 🚨 | **Status:** Complete ✅ | **Committed:** 702b733 | **Pushed:** ✅ | **Issue:** #13 (Closed)

**Issue Description:**
Production build testing revealed several critical issues that needed immediate attention:

1. **Excessive padding/margin around whole app** - Large empty space around entire application
2. **Unwanted header elements showing** - Title, buttons, and "Apps configured" message should not be visible (only sidebar + main section)
3. **Modal bottom buttons cut off** - When adding an app, the bottom buttons (Cancel/Add App) are not visible
4. **Terminal shows unexpected content** - Terminal immediately shows content when adding an app before any processes are started
5. **Start button not functional** - Click on Start button causes flicker but doesn't actually start processes
6. **Terminal commands are center-aligned** - Terminal text should be left-aligned like a proper terminal

**What was accomplished:**
- ✅ **Fixed excessive padding/margin** - Updated CSS to use `height: 100vh; width: 100vw;` for full window coverage
- ✅ **Removed unwanted header elements** - Eliminated title, buttons, and config info from top section (was already done)
- ✅ **Fixed modal bottom buttons cut off** - Improved modal body max-height calculation (increased from 140px to 160px)
- ✅ **Fixed terminal empty state** - Removed mock data (`MOCK_TERMINAL_LINES`), terminal now shows proper empty state when no processes running
- ✅ **Terminal text alignment confirmed** - Verified left-aligned terminal output using proper flexbox layout with `display: flex` and left-aligned content
- ✅ **Optimized React performance** - Added `useMemo` to terminal display lines to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ **Production build verification** - Successfully built and tested production executable

**Verified Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Remove all excessive padding/margin from app container (should fill window)
- ✅ Hide title, buttons, and app configuration message from top section
- ✅ Ensure only sidebar and main content area are visible in production build
- ✅ Fix modal sizing so bottom buttons are always visible and accessible
- ✅ Fix terminal to show empty/default state when no processes are running
- ✅ Fix terminal text alignment to be left-aligned instead of center-aligned
- ✅ Verify all fixes work in production build (`npm run tauri build`)
- ✅ Test on actual production executable, not just development server

**Production Build Results:**
- Built successfully with `npm run tauri build`
- Generated .deb, .rpm, and AppImage packages at:
  - `/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/oddbox_0.1.0_amd64.deb`
  - `/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/rpm/oddbox-0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm`
  - `/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage/oddbox_0.1.0_amd64.AppImage`
- All fixes verified working in production executable
